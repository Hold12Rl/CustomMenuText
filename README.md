# CustomMenuText

Tired of playing BEAT SABER? Would you rather play BEAT SAMER, YEET SABER, BEAT MYMEAT, or anything else? With this plugin, you can change the game's title in the main menu!  
Picks a random entry from a text file every time you enter the menu. The plugin comes preloaded with an example file, demonstrating the format and some advanced features like text color; see [the TextMeshPro docs](http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/rich-text/) for more ways to customize your custom text. Edit the file at `Beat Saber/UserData/CustomMenuText.txt`.

*Release notes for v2.1.1*  
To avoid people's configs getting overwritten when reinstalling the plugin after the update, I've renamed the file in the zip. If you haven't used CustomMenuText before, navigate to your Beat Saber install directory, go into the UserData folder, and rename `CustomMenuText-default-2.1.1.txt` to `CustomMenuText.txt`. Future releases of the plugin will handle this automatically.
